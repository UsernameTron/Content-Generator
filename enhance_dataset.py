Dataset Enhancement Script for C. Pete Connor Fine-tuning

This script creates higher-quality examples for fine-tuning by:
1. Ensuring consistent format with proper chat tokens
2. Generating examples across multiple content categories
3. Emphasizing direct, professional responses without "meta-commentary"

        "response": "API Rate Limiting: Think of it Like a Coffee Shop\n\nImagine you run a busy coffee shop with limited staff. You can serve a certain number of customers per hour efficiently, but if too many people show up at once, the quality of service suffers, lines grow longer, and eventually, you might have to turn people away.\n\nAPI rate limiting works similarly for digital services. When you use an app on your phone or a website, that app makes requests to a digital service (called an API) to fetch information or perform actions. The company providing this service needs to manage how many requests their systems handle to ensure everyone gets good service.\n\nRate limiting is their way of saying: \"You can make X number of requests per minute/hour/day.\" If an app tries to make too many requests too quickly, the service temporarily blocks additional requests with a polite \"please wait a bit\" message.\n\nThis system protects the service from being overwhelmed, prevents any single user from monopolizing resources, and helps maintain reliability for everyone. It's like the coffee shop ensuring that one customer doesn't order 100 drinks at once while others wait.\n\nFor everyday users, you rarely notice rate limits unless you're doing something unusual. For developers building apps, they need to work within these limits by spacing out requests or prioritizing the most important ones."

The user authentication system is currently at 90% completion and undergoing final testing.\n\n**Timeline Adjustment:**\nAs you may be aware, we're currently tracking 2 weeks behind our original delivery date. This delay stems from two primary factors:\n\n1. The third-party payment processing API integration revealed unexpected compatibility issues requiring additional development work.\n2. Our lead back-end developer was unexpectedly absent for 10 days due to a family emergency.\n\n**Mitigation Plan:**\nTo address these challenges, we have:\n\n1. Reassigned two developers from non-critical path tasks to assist with the payment integration\n2. Implemented extended development hours (voluntary, with compensation)\n3. Reprioritized the feature roadmap to ensure critical elements launch on time\n\n**Revised Timeline:**\nWith these adjustments, we project delivery of core functionality by March 15th, with secondary features to follow in a phased release approach by March 29th.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nA detailed revised project plan will be distributed by EOD Friday. I welcome any questions or concerns you might have during our weekly stakeholder call tomorrow at 11am.\n\nThank you for your continued support as we work toward delivering a robust and secure platform.\n\nSincerely,\n[Project Manager]"
