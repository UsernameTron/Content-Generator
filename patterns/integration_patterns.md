# Integration Patterns

This document catalogs integration patterns discovered during development of the multi-platform content generator system.

## Overview

Integration patterns solve challenges related to how components connect and communicate with each other in our system. This document serves as a reference for current and future development.

## Pattern Catalog

### PATH_BASED_RELATIONSHIP_ENCODING

**Problem:** When converting nested data structures to flat representations, semantic relationships and hierarchical information are lost, causing integration issues between components expecting different formats.

**Solution:** Use path-based encoding with semantic type markers to preserve relationships and hierarchical information in flat string representations.

**Implementation:**
- Prefix paths with semantic type markers (e.g., `p:` for properties, `m:` for metrics)
- Represent nested structures with dot notation (e.g., `patient.demographics.age`)
- Use array indexing for list elements (e.g., `conditions[0]`)
- Include relationship markers for explicit connections (e.g., `rel:path1->path2=relationship_type`)
- Support namespace prefixing for context disambiguation (e.g., `ctx:medical|p:patient.age`)

**Benefits:**
- Preserves semantic relationships when flattening data
- Enables components to work with both flat and nested representations
- Maintains contextual information across component boundaries
- Supports bidirectional conversion between formats

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Original nested structure
nested = {
    "patient": {
        "demographics": {
            "age": 65,
            "conditions": ["diabetes", "hypertension"]
        },
        "metrics": {
            "satisfaction": 0.85
        }
    }
}

# Flattened with path-based encoding
flattened = [
    "p:patient.demographics.age = 65",
    "p:patient.demographics.conditions[0] = diabetes",
    "p:patient.demographics.conditions[1] = hypertension",
    "m:patient.metrics.satisfaction = 0.85",
    "rel:patient.demographics.conditions[0]->patient.metrics.satisfaction = condition_influences_satisfaction"
]
```

### DYNAMIC_WEIGHT_PROPAGATION

**Problem:** Configuration parameters and weights aren't consistently propagated between components, leading to discrepancies in behavior across different execution paths.

**Solution:** Implement explicit weight propagation middleware that manages configuration across component boundaries.

**Implementation:**
- Create a shared configuration context object
- Implement configuration inheritance and overrides
- Support dynamic weight adjustment based on input complexity
- Provide automatic component-to-component parameter mapping

**Benefits:**
- Consistent configuration across components
- Automatic adaptation to input complexity
- Clearer debugging and tracing of configuration changes

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Create a configuration context
config_context = ConfigContext({
    "dynamic_weights": {
        "context_relevance": 0.35,
        "semantic_consistency": 0.25,
        "knowledge_integration": 0.25,
        "reasoning_depth": 0.15
    }
})

# When calling a component
result = component.process(input_data, config_context)

# Component automatically receives appropriate configuration
```

### ERROR_RECOVERY_MIDDLEWARE

**Problem:** Errors in one component cascade through the pipeline, causing failure even when partial results would be acceptable.

**Solution:** Implement component-specific fallback mechanisms that gracefully degrade functionality rather than failing completely.

**Implementation:**
- Add pre-validation of inputs with automatic correction
- Implement fallback logic for handling unexpected input types
- Create recovery mechanisms to generate partial results when full processing fails

**Benefits:**
- More robust system behavior under unexpected conditions
- Graceful degradation instead of catastrophic failure
- Better user experience with partial results vs. complete failures

**Usage Example:**
```python
try:
    result = process_complex_input(input_data)
except UnexpectedInputError as e:
    # Fall back to simpler processing
    logger.warning(f"Using fallback processing due to: {str(e)}")
    result = process_simple_input(input_data)
except Exception as e:
    # Last resort fallback
    logger.error(f"Using emergency fallback due to: {str(e)}")
    result = generate_minimal_result(input_data)
```
