# Adapter Patterns

This document catalogs adapter patterns used in the multi-platform content generator system.

## Overview

Adapter patterns facilitate communication between components with different interfaces or expectations. They help maintain modularity while ensuring components can work together effectively.

## Pattern Catalog

### CONTEXT_FORMAT_ADAPTER

**Problem:** Components expect context data in different formats (nested dictionaries, flat strings, structured objects), causing integration issues.

**Solution:** Create adapters that transparently convert between formats while preserving all semantic information.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement bidirectional conversion between formats
- Cache intermediate results to optimize repeated conversions
- Preserve metadata during conversions
- Support format detection to automatically apply appropriate conversions

**Benefits:**
- Components can process data in their preferred format
- Format-specific optimizations can be implemented without affecting other components
- Simplified testing since components can be tested with their native formats
- Reduced development complexity by eliminating format concerns within components

### PLATFORM_CONTENT_ADAPTER

**Problem:** Content needs to be adapted for multiple platforms with different requirements, formats, and constraints.

**Solution:** Create a pipeline of platform-specific adapters that transform content while preserving core meaning and intent.

**Implementation Details:**
- Define platform-specific constraints and requirements
- Create transformation rules for each target platform
- Implement content verification to ensure platform compatibility
- Support platform-specific optimization hints

**Benefits:**
- Consistent content experience across platforms
- Centralized management of platform-specific adaptations
- Clear separation between content generation and platform adaptation
- Simplified testing of platform-specific requirements

### MIDDLEWARE_ADAPTER

**Problem:** Components need to share information and state but have incompatible interfaces for doing so.

**Solution:** Implement middleware adapters that manage state transitions between components, providing appropriate interfaces to each.

**Implementation Details:**
- Define clear component interface contracts
- Create middleware objects that implement all required interfaces
- Manage state transformations between component boundaries
- Provide debugging and monitoring of inter-component communication

**Benefits:**
- Components can maintain their preferred interfaces
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Simplified testing of component interactions
- Improved error detection at component boundaries

### ERROR_RECOVERY_ADAPTER

**Problem:** Different components have different error handling mechanisms, making system-wide error recovery challenging.

**Solution:** Create error recovery adapters that translate between component-specific error models and provide consistent recovery mechanisms.

**Implementation Details:**
- Define system-wide error taxonomy
- Map component-specific errors to the common taxonomy
- Implement progressive fallback strategies
- Create error transformation logic to present errors appropriately to each component

**Benefits:**
- Consistent error handling across components
- Improved system resilience through standardized recovery strategies
- Better error reporting and debugging
- Simplified error handling within individual components
