# Context Processing Patterns

This document catalogs patterns related to context processing in the multi-platform content generator system.

## Overview

Context processing patterns address challenges in handling, transforming, and utilizing context information across different components of the system.

## Pattern Catalog

### PATH_BASED_RELATIONSHIP_ENCODING

**Problem:** Converting between nested hierarchical structures and flat representations causes loss of semantic relationships, which impacts reasoning capabilities, especially in complex contexts.

**Solution:** Encode relationship information in path strings using a structured notation system that preserves hierarchy and relationship metadata.

**Implementation Details:**

#### 1. Basic Path Encoding

```
Format: <type_marker>:<path> = <value>

Examples:
p:patient.demographics.age = 65
m:performance.metrics.satisfaction = 0.85
```

Type markers:
- `p:` - Property
- `m:` - Metric
- `v:` - Value
- `rel:` - Relationship
- `ctx:` - Context namespace
- `alias:` - Path alias

#### 2. Advanced Relationship Encoding

```
Format: rel:<source_path>-><target_path> = <relationship_type>

Examples:
rel:patient.demographics.conditions[0]->patient.metrics.satisfaction = condition_influences_satisfaction
rel:metrics.response_time->metrics.satisfaction = response_time_affects_satisfaction
```

#### 3. Context Disambiguation

```
Format: ctx:<namespace>|<type_marker>:<path> = <value>

Examples:
ctx:medical|p:patient.age = 65
ctx:billing|p:patient.age = 66
```

#### 4. Parent Path References

```
Format: <type_marker>:<path>.^.<sub_path> = <value>

Examples:
p:patient.demographics.conditions[0].severity = high
rel:^.severity->^^ = condition_severity_influences_patient
```

#### 5. Path Aliasing

```
Format: alias:<alias_name> = <full_path>

Examples:
alias:pd = patient.demographics
p:pd.age = 65
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves semantic relationships in flat representations
- Enables processing by components that expect either flat or nested structures
- Supports context-specific processing without information loss
- Facilitates efficient serialization and deserialization

### CONTEXT_TRANSFORMATION_PIPELINE

**Problem:** Different components expect context in different formats, requiring multiple conversions that may lose information.

**Solution:** Implement a standardized pipeline for context transformations with well-defined intermediate representations.

**Implementation Details:**
- Define canonical intermediate representation (CIR) for all context data
- Create adapters between component-specific formats and the CIR
- Implement lossless bidirectional conversion between formats
- Support lazy transformation to avoid unnecessary processing

**Benefits:**
- Reduces conversion errors and information loss
- Centralizes transformation logic for easier maintenance
- Enables component-specific optimizations without affecting the overall pipeline
- Provides clear debugging points for tracing context changes

### CONTEXT_COMPLEXITY_DETECTION

**Problem:** Components need to adapt processing based on the complexity of input context, but complexity assessment varies across components.

**Solution:** Implement standardized complexity detection that triggers appropriate processing adaptations.

**Implementation Details:**
- Define objective complexity metrics (depth, breadth, relationship count)
- Create complexity scoring algorithm that produces a normalized complexity score
- Implement automatic processing parameter adjustment based on complexity
- Support explicit complexity hints for edge cases

**Benefits:**
- Consistent handling of complex contexts across components
- Automatic resource allocation based on input complexity
- Improved performance through adaptive processing
- Better handling of edge cases and unusual contexts
