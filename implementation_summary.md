## System Architecture

The system is organized into the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Fine-Tuning Pipeline**:
   - `prepare_training_data.py`: Prepares training data from existing content examples
   - `finetune_model.py`: Implements LoRA fine-tuning with custom loss functions
   - `setup_wandb_training.py`: Configures W&B monitoring for training
   - `run_finetune.command`: Desktop launcher for the fine-tuning process

2. **Content Generation**:
   - `src/models/model_content_generator.py`: Model-based content generation
   - `src/models/content_generator.py`: Template-based content generation (fallback)
   - `src/models/platform_specs.py`: Platform-specific parameters and formatting

3. **User Interface**:
   - `src/app_model.py`: Streamlit interface focused on platforms with model generation
   - `src/app.py`: Original Streamlit interface with writing style selection

4. **Utilities**:
   - `src/utils/health_monitor.py`: System resource monitoring
   - `src/utils/document_processor.py`: Text extraction from various document formats
   - `src/utils/wandb_monitor.py`: W&B integration for monitoring
   - `setup_data.py`: Data initialization and setup
   
### Data Flow

1. **During Fine-Tuning**:
   - Writing examples from `writing_style.json` are extracted and processed
   - Training data is prepared with platform-specific prompts
   - The model is fine-tuned using LoRA with training progress tracked in W&B
   - The resulting model is saved to `outputs/finetune/final`

2. **During Content Generation**:
   - User provides input text and selects a platform
   - Input is processed and formatted as a prompt for the fine-tuned model
   - The model generates content tailored to the selected platform
   - Generated content is analyzed for sentiment and displayed to the user
   - If the model is unavailable, template-based generation serves as a fallback

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - System health metrics (CPU, memory, disk) are continuously monitored
   - Content generation metrics are logged to W&B when available
   - Generation examples are stored for quality analysis

## Improvements and Benefits

1. **Content Quality**:
   - More consistent and distinctive voice across all platforms
   - Better adaptation to each platform's requirements
   - Improved sentiment analysis and keyword utilization

2. **Monitoring Capabilities**:
   - Real-time tracking of content generation metrics
   - Visualization of performance and quality trends
   - Early detection of resource issues

3. **User Experience**:

   - More options for content customization
   - Clearer feedback on system status

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Better organization with clear separation of concerns
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - More consistent logging and monitoring

5. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - One-click installation and launch process makes deployment simple
   - Platform-focused UI simplifies content generation workflows
   - Desktop shortcuts provide quick access to the application
   - Improved error handling provides better feedback to users

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Writing Styles**: Framework is ready to add more writing styles
