    Multi-Format Content Generator: A Modern Approach to Content Creation
    
    Content creation for multiple platforms is a time-consuming process that requires adapting the same information to different formats, styles, and audience expectations. This project aims to simplify this process by providing a tool that can automatically generate platform-specific content from a single source.
    
    Key features include:
    - Template-based content generation
    - Sentiment analysis to adapt tone
    - Platform-specific formatting
    - Keyword extraction for relevant hashtags
    - Support for multiple input sources (text, documents, URLs)
    
    The applications of this tool extend to marketing teams, content creators, social media managers, and anyone who needs to publish consistent content across multiple platforms efficiently.
