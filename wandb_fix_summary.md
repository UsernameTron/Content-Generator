# WandB Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The Weights & Biases (W&B) authentication issue has been successfully resolved. This was a critical blocker that prevented proper tracking of model training metrics and progress.

## Actions Taken

1. **API Key Configuration**
   - Identified the existing W&B API key in the user's .netrc file
   - Updated the .env file with the valid API key
   - Verified the API key works for authentication

2. **Script Fixes**
   - Fixed the `check_wandb_status.py` script to properly authenticate with W&B
   - Corrected API usage for checking active runs
   - Implemented more reliable authentication verification

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - Created and executed a test script (`test_wandb.py`) that successfully logs metrics to W&B
   - Verified that the test run appears in the W&B project
   - Confirmed the ability to view recent runs and their metrics

4. **Offline Run Synchronization**
   - Successfully synchronized 5 offline runs to the W&B server
   - All previous training data is now available in the W&B dashboard

## Current Status

All W&B integration checks are now PASSING:
- Environment: ✅ PASS
- Installation: ✅ PASS
- Config Files: ✅ PASS
- Local Files: ✅ PASS
- Active Runs: ✅ PASS

## Next Steps

1. **Model Testing**
   - Now that W&B is properly configured, run comprehensive model testing using the enhanced test script
   - All test metrics will be logged to W&B for proper tracking

2. **Fine-tuning Monitoring**
   - Continue or restart fine-tuning with proper metric tracking
   - Monitor training progress through the W&B dashboard

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Use the W&B dashboard to analyze model performance across domains
   - Identify areas for improvement based on metrics visualization
