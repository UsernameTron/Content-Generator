Pete Connor MS, CCCM\n...", "# The it\u02bcs Emperor Has No Clothes\n\nI've been thinking about it\u02bcs lately and wanted to share some thoughts.\n\n## The Industry Narrative\nEdit article\nView stats\nView post\n\ud83d\udea8If we can't be real, then lets not\nplay.\n\n## What The Data Actually Shows\n\u2022 Research shows C. Pete Connor MS, CCCM\nAugust 30, 2024\nCX Strategy & AI Innovator | Creator of MindMeld\nGPT | Data-Driven VOC & Predictive Analytics |\u2026\nLet\u02bcs break down the key takeaways of the book\"Lets Get Real or Lets\nnot Play\"in a more down-to-earth, but meaningful way.\n\n\u2022 Studies indicate that At the end of the day, consultants and clients are really on the same\nteam.\n\n\u2022 According to the data, We both want to create value.\n\n\u2022 If we nail that, everyone\u02bcs happy.\n\n## Case Studies\n## Case Studies: The it\u02bcs Hall of Shame\n\nLet's examine three spectacular implementation disasters that somehow never make it into the glossy vendor case studies. Names have been changed to protect the embarrassed (and my potential legal liability):\n\n### Enterprise Resource Planning Dumpster Fire at MegaCorp\nInvestment: $36 million upfront + $28 million in emergency consulting fees\nPromised efficiency improvement: 40%\nActual improvement: 5% (and that's being generous)\nFinal outcome: They reverted to their legacy systems after a three-year odyssey of pain\n\nThe technical post-mortem revealed fundamental flaws in the vendor's database architecture that collapsed under actual enterprise workloads. The vendor's response? \"Your data is more complex than typical implementations.\" Translation: \"We never actually tested this at scale before selling it to you.\"\n\nThe cherry on top: The CIO who approved the project received a promotion before the implementation failed, leaving his successor to deal with the aftermath. That's called 'strategic career timing.'\n\n### Machine Learning Snake Oil at HealthSystems Inc.\nThe sales pitch: \"Our AI delivers diagnostic assistance with 98% accuracy!\"\nThe reality: 73% accuracy in carefully controlled environments, less than 60% in actual production\nCost of learning this lesson: $12 million and 18 months of wasted time\n\nWhen confronted with the accuracy gap, the vendor actually said with a straight face: \"The algorithm is working correctly; your medical data doesn't match our expected patterns.\" I'm not making this up. They literally blamed reality for not conforming to their model.\n\nThe funniest part? The same vendor is now selling an \"enhanced version\" to other healthcare systems using HealthSystems as a reference... without mentioning they were fired.\n\n### Blockchain Fantasy at Global Logistics Corp\nPromised ROI: $45 million in annual savings\nActual ROI: Negative $23 million\nTransaction throughput promised: \"Enterprise-grade\"\nActual throughput: 30 transactions per second (when a minimum of 200 TPS was explicitly required)\n\nThe vendor's solution to the performance problem was truly inspired: \"Just process fewer transactions.\" Revolutionary advice! Why didn't Global Logistics think of simply having fewer customers and shipping fewer products?\n\nThe project was eventually abandoned, but not before three executives added \"Blockchain Transformation Leader\" to their LinkedIn profiles. They all work at different companies now, presumably implementing blockchain solutions there too. The circle of life continues.\n\n## Industry Trends\n## Industry Trends: The Gap Between Hype and Reality\n\nWhen we examine industry analyst reports on it\u02bcs implementations from the past five years, a clear pattern emerges:\n\n1. **Initial Projection Phase**: Analysts predict explosive growth and transformative impact\n2. **Peak Inflated Expectations**: Vendors flood the market with increasingly exaggerated claims\n3. **Implementation Reality**: Early adopters begin reporting significant challenges\n4. **Revised Expectations**: Analysts quietly update their projections downward\n5. **Rebranding Phase**: The same core technology is repackaged under new terminology\n\nThis cycle typically completes every 24-36 months, yet organizations continue to base major investment decisions on the projections made during phases 1 and 2.\n\nThe data shows that organizations that wait until phase 3 before making investment decisions achieve on average 340% better ROI than early adopters, yet executive incentives continue to reward 'innovation' over prudent technology adoption practices.\n\n## The Way Forward\nIn conclusion, it\u02bcs shows how we continue to fall for the same implementation myths. The empirical evidence couldn't be clearer: organizations need to fundamentally rethink their approach to implementation, or they'll keep achieving that perfect 0% success rate they seem to be aiming for.\n\nInstead of swallowing vendor promises like a sleep-deprived college student at an all-you-can-eat buffet, technical teams should prioritize:\n\n1. Establishing clear, measurable success metrics before any implementation begins (revolutionary concept, I know)\n2. Creating robust data validation protocols that verify vendor claims independently (spoiler alert: their case studies are cherry-picked fairy tales)\n3. Implementing phased deployments with defined fallback procedures (because 'big bang' implementations always end with an actual bang)\n4. Maintaining parallel systems during transition periods to enable objective performance comparisons (trust, but verify\u2014and by 'trust' I mean 'don't trust at all')\n\nAnd here's a bonus tip that vendors hate: document every promise made during the sales cycle and include it in the contract as a condition of payment. Watch how quickly those 'guaranteed outcomes' turn into 'aspirational goals.'\n\nLet's be honest\u2014most organizations will ignore this advice because executives love shiny new toys more than they love actual results. But for the brave few willing to prioritize reality over hype, these approaches can mean the difference between an implementation that delivers value and one that delivers r\u00e9sum\u00e9-updating opportunities for the entire project team. \ud83d\ude4c", true]]}
